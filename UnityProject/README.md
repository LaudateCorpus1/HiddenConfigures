Repository for our subconcious bias test for Human Centered Requirements and Design (SWEN-444). 

Unity Version: 5.6.0f3

Setup:
The project can be opened in Unity 5.6.0f3 by opening one of the Scene files in the Assets/Scenes folder, or opening the project folder as a Unity project.
Once the project imported and the MainMenu scene is open, you may press the Play button on the top of the screen to run the application. Unfortunately the swiping mechanism only works on a mobile device, and not in the emulator on Unity.
The project may be built as to an android APK through the build feature in Unity.
The script files written in C# are located in the Scripts folder.
